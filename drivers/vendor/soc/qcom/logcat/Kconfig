config DUAL_SYSTEM_LOGCAT
	bool "DUAL SYSTEM LOGCAT"
	---help---
	  Note that enabling this will open DUAL SYSTEM KERNEL LOG DRIVER.

config ANDROID_LOGGER
	tristate "Android log driver"
	default n
	---help---
	  Just Config a feature to adapt P \ Q and other later platform.

config ANDROID_ZLOG
	tristate "Android log driver"
	default n
	---help---
	  This adds support for system-wide logging using four log buffers.

	  These are:

	      1: main
	      2: events
	      3: radio
	      4: system

	  Log reading and writing is performed via normal Linux reads and
	  optimized writes. This optimization avoids logging having too
	  much overhead in the system.

config ANDROID_ZLOG_BUFFER
	bool "Zte uses the android kernel logger buffer"
	depends on ANDROID_ZLOG
	default n
	---help---
	  This adds support for unnecessary creating zlog buffers.

	  Logger will check whether android zlog buffer should be created:

	      N: kern_transport param is 0
	      N: user build version with no kern_transport param
	      Y: kern_transport param is 1
	      Y: userdebug or eng with no kern_transport param

config ANDROID_ZLOG_LOW_MEM
	bool "Zte uses less buffer size when low mem config detected"
	depends on ANDROID_ZLOG
	default n
	---help---
	  This adds support for low memory configuration for zlog buffers.
	  Logger will check whether low mem config is used:
	      Y: totalram_pages <= 512M
	  If yes, a ratio factor will be used to decrease the buffer size.
